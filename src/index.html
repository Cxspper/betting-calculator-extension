						<h3 class="text-md font-bold">How to Convert Sports Betting Odds</h3>
						<p class="text-sm">Decimal odds are the standard odds format in most countries, and the odds quote the potential payout should the bet win. As an example, if you wager $100 on 2.0 decimal odds and your bet wins, your total payout is $200 (2.0 x $100 = $200). This payout includes your initial stake, so you need to subtract your initial stake ($100) to determine your profit: $200 - $100 = $100 profit. As you can see in the odds converter, 2.0 is equivalent to +100 American odds and 1/1 fractional odds.</p>
						<p class="text-sm">American odds are the main odds format in the US. Positive figures (e.g. +200, +450) represent total profit should the bet win, assuming the bet size is $100. In other words, betting $100 at +200 odds means that you profit $200 if your bet wins. Negative figures (e.g. -200, -450) represent how much a bettor must wager to win $100 profit. In other words, if a wager is -200 odds, a bettor must place $200 to earn $100 profit. As shown in the odds converter, -200 American odds is equivalent to 1.5 decimal odds and 1/2 fractional odds.</p>
						<p class="text-sm">Fractional odds are mainly used in the UK, as well as Ireland. This odds format shows the potential profit should the bet win, quoted as a fraction of the stake. As an example, if you bet $100 on 1/2 (or 0.5) fractional odds and your bet wins, you will earn $50 profit (1/2 x $100). As shown in the odds converter, 1/2 is equivalent to -200 American odds and 1.5 decimal odds.</p>
						<p class="text-sm">The odds converter also calculates the breakeven win probability of a given odd, which can be very useful when evaluating a bet. For example, if you place a bet at +100 odds, then the breakeven win probability is 50%. You should only place this wager if you believe the “true” or “fair” probability of the wager winning is greater than 50%. On the other hand, if you place a bet at +900 odds, then the breakeven win probability is only 10%. You only need to win +900 wagers 1/10 times to breakeven. So if you evaluate a bet as having a 12.5% chance of winning, then this bet is mathematically profitable. The “true” odds are > 10%</p>
